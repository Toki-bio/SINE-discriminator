"""Derive the element window from the copies, not from the consensus.

The defect this replaces, in measure_c.py:91 and justify_all.py:24:

    nz = np.where(cons != GAP)[0]
    lo, hi = int(nz[0]), int(nz[-1])

The window is the consensus's first and last non-gap column, taken on faith.
Nothing checks it against the copies, so an over-extended consensus puts real
flank inside the element (where justify never degaps it) and an under-extended
one puts real element outside (where justify degaps it away).

The rule here is step7's, applied per column of an existing alignment instead of
by re-extracting windows from the genome:

  occupancy(col)    fraction of copies with a base there
  conservation(col) fraction of those bases that are the majority base

step7 calls a window background when its ELEVATED fraction - pairs above 45 %
identity - falls to what random genomic regions give. The per-column analogue of
"elevated" is conservation > 0.45; random DNA sits near 0.25-0.30, and measured
on soft-masked Timema the true genomic background is 0.272.

A column is part of the element when occupancy >= OCC and conservation >= CONS.
Starting from the consensus's own supported core, walk outward on each side and
stop after MISS consecutive failing columns, so a single ragged column does not
end the element. That both trims an over-extended consensus and extends an
under-extended one, with the same rule and no per-set tuning.

CONS_EDGE (0.50) is stricter: used when assigning letters to the consensus row
after step8a (`rebuild_consensus_row.py`).  Columns at 0.45-0.49 are elevated
but ambiguous vs random DNA (~0.25-0.30) and must not become consensus bases.
Display justify keeps the 0.45 walk; consensus rebuild does not re-derive span
from copy walks (span stays from border-loop geometry in row 0).
