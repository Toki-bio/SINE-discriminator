"""Replace row-0 consensus with per-column majority from copies in this MSA.

step8a pastes a pre-MAFFT conse sequence as row 0; after MAFFT + --adjustdirection
it often no longer matches copy columns.  Rebuild row 0 from the copies in the
same file, then boundary_justify adjusts display case/flanks.

Universal rule (every species / subfamily — no per-set tuning):

  WHERE — element span comes from the alignment geometry already in the file:
          row-0 uppercase columns (border loop BED + step8a extract + any prior
          justify).  Re-walking copy columns to choose span pulls in MAFFT
          column noise (oma_SINE18: an A-rich block left of the real element).

  WHAT  — letters inside that span are copy-column majority, included only when
          CONS_EDGE=0.50 (boundary.py).  Columns at 0.45-0.49 are elevated but
          ambiguous vs random DNA (~0.25-0.30) and must not become consensus
          bases (oma_SINE10 leading T; oma_SINE18 trailing ATT).

  TRIM  — outermost letters still failing CONS_EDGE are dropped (handles internal
          gaps at the 3 prime edge).

Run after boundary_justify, not before. boundary_justify is what establishes
the element=upper/flank=lower case convention this file's element_rows() and
consensus_span() depend on (boundary.column_stats folds case, so it doesn't
need it -- but element_rows() here deliberately does not, "lowercase flanks
treated as gaps" is intentional once the convention is real). Run before
boundary_justify and case is whatever the raw genome's native soft-masking
happens to be at each locus -- unrelated to element boundaries, and the
per-column majority vote finds almost no columns where copies agree.
Confirmed root cause of oma_SINE10's published top100 row-0 collapsing to
5bp (2026-09-09) -- fixed in align_for_publish.sh by reordering the two.

    Row-0's own uppercase can under-report a genuine extension when the seed
    consensus has a GAP where the copies carry real, well-supported sequence.
    boundary_justify.py's element_window walk already finds the correct wider
    window in that case (its own log line reads "extend L=6 R=3" etc.) -- but
    justify() can only re-case EXISTING characters, and a gap has no case, so
    the extension is computed and then silently dropped. This function used
    to trust row-0's (still-unextended) uppercase span alone whenever it was
    non-empty, so it never looked at the columns that needed filling in.

    Confirmed on oma_SINE10 top100 (2026-09-09): the true element starts
    "GTCGGCCGGATTGG..." (columns 97-102, 90-99% copy agreement, GTCGG),
    while row-0's uppercase span started 6 columns later at "CCGGATTGG...".
    Taking the union recovers it: the copy-supported walk correctly proposes
    lo=97, and the majority-vote loop below fills in the real bases there.
