"""Slide the element edge out along ungapped flanks until flanks are unique.

Does not use alignment columns. Each copy's flank is the ungapped sequence
outside the current consensus, with position 0 touching the consensus edge.
Two flanks "share" when the first WIN bases agree at >= THR (the same cut
verdict.py uses: 0.55 over up to 70 bp, at least 35 bp compared).

Groups are single-linkage, same as flank_uniqueness.py. A depth d moves the
edge d bases out; the flank used for the test is whatever remains beyond d.

Stops are reported for three readings of "no 2-5 copies share":
  largest cluster <= 1   no two copies share
  largest cluster <= 2   no three copies share
  largest cluster <= 4   no five copies share
