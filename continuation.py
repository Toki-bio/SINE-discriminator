"""How far past the original consensus the copies stay similar to one another.

His review of rsi r1_9seqs (2026-09-28): past the right end the copies continue with the same
sequence (an A-run of variable length, then gtcctggaagtacacactgttccccaataaagtcctgttcccc...) for
~170 bp. That region must be shown ALIGNED until similarity is lost; the chain packed it as flank,
and because the A-runs differ in length the shared sequence landed at different offsets.

The column walk cannot see it: MAFFT splits such a stretch into blocks that different copies occupy,
so column occupancy jumps between 0.1 and 0.9 and the walk's half-the-copies rule fails. This
measures it per copy instead. For every copy, its own bases are read outward from the original's
edge; a base scores 1 when it equals the majority base of its column (columns reached by at least
MIN_PRESENT copies). A WIN-base window slides along the copy; the median over copies at each offset
is the similarity profile. Measured on the bat corpus (raw step8a alignments):

    rsi r1_9seqs 3'   0.95 to offset ~160, 0.68 at 180, 0.45-0.50 from 200 on
    cse MEG-T2   3'   1.00, but only 12 % of copies still have sequence at offset 60
    rda Rhin-1   3'   0.55 at the edge, 0.40 from offset 20: the element ends there
    rsi MEG-RL   5'   0.38-0.50 from the edge: no continuation (the TGGGGGAAATA case)

Unrelated flank sits at 0.40-0.47 (MAFFT pulls similar bases into shared columns even there); shared
sequence at 0.9-1.0. SIM_LOST = 0.60 is between the two.

Status per side:
    none        the profile is below SIM_LOST at the edge: nothing shared
    ends        it falls below SIM_LOST while >= MIN_COVER of the copies still have sequence
    unresolved  the copies run out (< MIN_COVER left) while still similar: extract more flank

Usage: continuation.py ALIGNMENT.aln.fa [--need]
  --need  print "<extra_5p_bp> <extra_3p_bp>" to extract (0 = resolved); step8a uses this.
